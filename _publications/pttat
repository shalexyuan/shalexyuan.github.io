title: "An assistive low-vision platform that augments spatial cognition through proprioceptive guidance: Point-to-Tell-and-Touch"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/pttat
excerpt: 'Spatial cognition, as gained through the sense of vision, is one of the most important capabilities of human beings. However, for the visually impaired (VI), lack of this perceptual capability poses great challenges in their life. Therefore, we have designed Point-to-Tell-and-Touch, a wearable system with an ergonomic human-machine interface, for assisting the VI with active environmental exploration, with a particular focus on spatial intelligence and navigation to objects of interest in an alien environment.'
