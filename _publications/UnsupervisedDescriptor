excerpt: 'Deep learning models have achieved great success in supervised shape descriptor learning for 3D shape retrieval, classification, and correspondence. However, the unsupervised shape descriptor calculated via deep learning is less studied than that of supervised ones due to the design challenges of unsupervised neural network architecture. '
