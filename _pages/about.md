Hi! I’m Shuaihang, a Ph.D. student at New York University. I’m a student who focuses on computer science since the very first year of my university life. Especially, the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence, and particularly, I'm interested in the development of state-of-the-art techniques in large-scale visual computing, deep visual learning, deep cross-domain model, and their applications in engineering, social science, medicine, and biology.

I received my B.S. from the Stony Brook University, my M.S. from the New York University, and my B.A and it is my first year Ph.D. at New York University and New York University Abu Dhabi. I’m a serious and dedicated person aiming at inventing and deploying human-friendly algorithms and applications. I'd like to integrate computer science, mathematics with fields like philosophy, sociology, biology. In terms of an academic student, I spend a lot of my time in the reading papers and working through experiments.
